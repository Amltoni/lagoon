# Kubernetes Jobs (`kubernetesjobs`)

Runs a Lagoon task for a project environment running in a Kubernetes cluster. It
validates the request, creates a job container in Kubernetes, and then the
Kubernetes Job Monitor service takes over.

Some errors that can occur during the running are tolerable and/or expected in
which case the request will be requeued and retried after some delay.
