# Notifications

_Notifications_ are how Lagoon informs users about what's going on with their projects. There are several types of notifications:

 - Slack
 - RocketChat
 - Email
 - Webhook
 - Microsoft Teams

A project can have one or more notifications. Organizations have a notification quota for all of their projects. Notifications are created independently of projects, and can then be assigned to one or more projects.
