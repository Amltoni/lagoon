## Upgrades

### Upgrade to v2.10.x first
You *must* upgrade to Lagoon v2.10.x before upgrading to v2.11.0. Ensure you read all the linked [release notes](./2.10.0.md#release-links).

### Essential database backups
Ensure you have a local backup of the api-db and keycloak-db before you commence this update, as there are complex migrations taking place in preparation for the v2.12.0 release.

## Deprecations

### Storage Calculator removed from core
The storage-calculator service was removed from core in this release, and the service is now included in lagoon-remote.
