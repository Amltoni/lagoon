There are no required actions or considerations with this release. As always, we suggest upgrading all minor versions.

## Deprecations

### Deleted Backups
* When a backup is deleted via the webhook, it will now actually removed from the API rather than being flagged as deleted. The `Backup` type field `deleted` is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. Additionally, `includeDeleted` if requested when querying backups will not change the result as there will be no deleted backups to include.
