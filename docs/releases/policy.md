## Upgrade Policy

Our general policy is that you should upgrade to the latest version of each minor version before you upgrade to the latest version.

You should check all upgrade requirements and deprecation notices for all versions as you upgrade.

An example of this policy is as follows

* Currently installed v2.13.0, planning to upgrade to v2.16.0
  1. Upgrade to v2.14.2 (the latest 2.14.x release)
  2. Upgrade to v2.15.4 (the latest 2.15.x release)
  3. Upgrade to v2.16.0

We may, from time to time, provide additional context to the upgrades listed in these pages.

## Deprecation Policy

As Lagoon continues to evolve, we occasionally need to replace, rename or retire existing processes, tools or configuration. Where this may impact a user's processes or procedures, we intend to outline a timeframe to allow any necessary changes to be made.

Deprecations will be tracked by the release they are announced in, and then updated when the actual deprecation occurs. All deprecations should provide a rough timeline (in months or releases).

We may, from time to time, provide additional context to the deprecations listed in these pages.
